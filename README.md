# my_portfolio_website

Welcome to my portfolio website repository. This project was made for me to both learn Sass and Bootstrap with having a website that will look more modern and also help me gain traction by having a portfolio website that shows some of my programming abilities. I have been working on this project for a little bit and it's not going to be overly complicated. I plan to save more advance stuff for other projects and keep this simple, functional, and easy to navigate.

- This project was made for my portfolio website. It's also a project used to learn how to get better with bootstrap and sass.
- Included in this repo is all of my coding work to make my website work, the website link seen below, and screenshots.
